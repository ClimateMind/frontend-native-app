# Requirements
1. Transporter App from the app store.
2. Access to Apple connect.
3. Access to Expo Dev.
4. Valid Apple id.

# Adding new developers to apple connect
*** This step must be done first by the account holder Kameron Rodrigues or anyone else with appropriate permissions ***. In order to publish an app once a developer account and licence has been obtained, the account holder can then proceed to login through Apple Connect and grant access to anyone with a valid [ apple id ](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108647) through selecting 'users and access'.

# Obtaining the Expo build file
You'll also need access to Expo Dev ( Please request this with the dev lead - currently Sven Firmbach ). Once a new build has been manually generated by the dev lead, the Expo build file can be obtained from the builds tab of the Expo Dev tool.

Open the latest build and download the build file to your local machine

# Delivering the build with Transporter
Assuming you have downloaded Transporter [( See install guide for all supported operating platforms including Windows )](https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/en.lproj/static.html ) from the app store onto your local machine, open Transporter and ensure you are signed in. 

Once signed in add the Expo build file you have downloaded and select 'Add App'. Locate and select the build file and then select 'Deliver' and wait for the build to upload to Apple Connect.

# Publishing the latest build with Apple Connect

Now go to the connect app, login and select 'Apps'.  Select the ' + ' sign from the top left hand side and add the new build which should have a new version number.

Verify all of the information is correct and enter the reason for a new build eg 'bug fixes, new features'.
