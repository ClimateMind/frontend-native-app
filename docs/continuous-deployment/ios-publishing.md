# Requirements
1. Transporter App from the app store.
2. Access to Apple connect.
3. Access to Expo Dev.
4. Valid Apple id.

# adding new developers to apple connect
***This step must be done first***. In order to publish an app once a developer account and licence has been obtained the account holder can then proceed to login through Apple Connect https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login and grant access to anyone who wishes to publish the IOS app through 'users and access'.

# Expo build file
You'll need Access to Expo Dev ( please request this with Sven Firmbach ). Once a new build has been manually generated by the dev lead you'll be notified and the Expo build file can be obtained from the builds tab of the Expo Dev tool.
