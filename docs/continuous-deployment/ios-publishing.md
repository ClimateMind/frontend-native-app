# Requirements
1. Transporter App from the app store.
2. Access to Apple connect.
3. Access to Expo Dev.
4. Valid Apple id.

# adding new developers to apple connect
***This step must be done first***. In order to publish an app once a developer account and licence has been obtained the account holder can then proceed to login through Apple Connect https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login and grant access to anyone who wishes to publish the IOS app through 'users and access'.

# Expo build file
You'll also need access to Expo Dev ( Please request this with the dev lead ). Once a new build has been manually generated by the dev lead ( currently Sven Firmbach ) you'll be notified via slack and the Expo build file can be obtained from the builds tab of the Expo Dev tool.

Download this file to your local machine

# Transporter
Assuming you have downloaded Transporter (see install guide for all supported operating platforms including Windows https://help.apple.com/itc/transporteruserguide/en.lproj/static.html )from the app store onto your local machine, open Transporter and ensure you are signed in. 
Once signed in add the expo build file you have downloaded and select 'Add App'. Locate and select the build file and then select 'Deliver'

# Apple Connect

Now go to the connect app, login and select 'Apps'. Add the new build which should have a new version number
