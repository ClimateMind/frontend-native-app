<h2>Setup a Development Environment</h2>
Getting ready to start programming is very easy.

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Make sure to run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Launch Expo with the command `npm start`

To view the app, you have two possibilities, running it on your own device or in an emulator.
The easier one is to run it on your own device. Install the Expo app and scan the QR code in the terminal where you entered `npm start`.
Running it in an emulator requires to setup the emulator with Android Studio (Android) or xCode (iOS).
